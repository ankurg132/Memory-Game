# Memory-Game
Memory Game is a game created using Kotlin which lets the user play a memory game where you need to select two consecutive card of the same type out of a grid of unfolded card. 
This game is a good way of improvising one's memory with a good play.

## What's more? 
Well, more than just playing, you can add your own image card here. Isn't it great? 

## Contributing
There are lots of improvements possible in the game and I'm open to any changes. Simply fork this repo and raise an issue and I would be happy to assign you.

The game is inspired by a memory game tutorial at [YouTube - Freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2DBDZKkLss), I highly recommend this to anyone getting started with Kotlin.
